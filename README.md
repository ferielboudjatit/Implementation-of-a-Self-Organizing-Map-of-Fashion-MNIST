Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is one of the most widely used unsupervised learning models. The basic idea of a SOM is to map the data patterns onto an n-dimensional grid of neurons
or units. That grid forms what is known as the output space, as opposed to the input space, where the data patterns are. This mapping is intended for applications in which maintaining a
topology between input and output spaces is of importance, as to allow an easy visualization, the output space is usually 1 or 2-dimensional.

A valuable detail is that Self Organizing Maps are aptly named “Self-Organizing” because the entire learning occurs without supervision i.e. the nodes are self-organizing, and no supervision is required.
